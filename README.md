## Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

Exploratory data analysis is a complement to inferential statistics, which tends to be fairly rigid with rules and formulas. At an advanced level, EDA involves looking at and describing the data set from different angles and then summarizing it.


#### Data Analysis:

Data Analysis is the statistics and probability to figure out trends in the data set. It is used to show historical data by using some analytics tools. It helps in drilling down the information, to transform metrics, facts, and figures into initiatives for improvement.

*Handle Missing value
*Removing duplicates
*Outlier Treatment
*Normalizing and Scaling( Numerical Variables)
